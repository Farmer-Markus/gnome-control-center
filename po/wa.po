"This generates random cloud-like patterns.  It looks quite different in "
"monochrome and color.  The basic idea is to take four points on the edge of "
"the image, and assign each a random ``elevation''.  Then find the point "
"between them, and give it a value which is the average of the other four, "
"plus some small random offset.  Then coloration is done based on "
"elevation.  \n"
"\n"
"The color selection is done by binding the elevation to either hue, "
"saturation, or brightness, and assigning random values to the others.  The "
"``brightness'' mode tends to yield cloudlike patterns, and the others tend "
