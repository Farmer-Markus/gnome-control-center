## Pull Request Process

1. Create a fork in GitLab and push your work to there
2. Open a Merge Request
  1. Always allow maintainer edits
  2. Mark the Merge Request as WIP if your work is not ready to be reviewed
3. Assign the correct maintainer to the Merge Request (see [`MAINTAINERS.md`][maintainers] to select
   the correct maintainer)
4. Format commit messages as follows:
   ```
   component: <summary>
   ‌
   A paragraph explaining the problem and its context.
   ‌
   Another one explaining how you solved that.
   ‌
   <link to the issue>
   ```
4. You may merge the pull request in once you have the sign-off of the maintainers, or if you
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
