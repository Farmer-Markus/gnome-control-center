- Make transitions between pages always be contiguous
  the children list order affects the paint order - so you can use set_child_above_sibling/set_child_below_sibling
- Add a scroll direction to the animation
  (back to parent to the left, to a child to the right)
- Figure out stage colour, from theme
- Only destroy the existing panel once we've finished scrolling
  - get_transition('scroll-to') after calling scroll_to_point(), and connect to the 'completed' signal on it
  - alternatively, you can use 'transitions-completed' on the actor
    but that will be called once every transition is finished - e.g. position, size, rotation, etc.
