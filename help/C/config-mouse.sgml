      The mouse capplet in the <application>GNOME Control
	Center</application> helps to configure properties of the mouse,
      such as: whether you're left handed or right handed, sensitivity,
      and mouse speed.

    <title>Hand Orientation</title>
    <para>
      A mouse behaves differently based on whether the user is right
      or left handed.  If they're right handed, the left button is the
      action button, while the right button is the menu button.  The
      mouse also typically sits on the right hand side of the desk.
      If the user is left handed, they use the right button as the
      action button, while the left button is the menu button.  It
      also sits on the left hand of the desk.
    </para>
    <para>
      To configure the hand orientation, select either <guibutton>Left
      handed</guibutton> or <guibutton>Right handed</guibutton> based
      on your preference.

    <title>Mouse Speed</title>
    <para>
      The mouse pointer can move at different speeds across the
      screen.  Everyone has their favorite speed, so the ability to
      configure this is important.
    </para>
    <para>
      To set your mouse speed, move the bar to either faster or slower
      in the <guilabel>Mouse speed</guilabel> section.  Afterwards,
      click <guibutton>Apply</guibutton> to test the speed.  Once you
      select your desired speed, click <guibutton>Close</guibutton>.

  <sect2 id="sensitivity">
    <title>Sensitivity</title>
    <para>
      Sensitivity is slightly different from mouse speed.  Sensitivity
      sets how much movement must the mouse recieve in order for the
      system to detect the change.  The way to configure the
      sensitivity is the same as mouse speed: Drag the sensitivity bar
      to the left or the right.  To test the setting, click
      <guibutton>Apply</guibutton> and <guibutton>Close</guibutton> to
      save.
